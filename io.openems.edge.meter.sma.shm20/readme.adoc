= SMA Sunny Home Manager 2.0 Integrated Meter

Implementation of the SMA Sunny Home Manager SHM 2.0.

== Compatibility

** Sunny Home Manager 2.0 (with Sunny Island 4.4M (Device Type: 9279 )
** Sunny Home Manager 2.0 (with Sunny Island 8.0H (Device Type: 9334 )
** Sunny Home Manager 2.0 (with SMA STP 15.000TL-20)



== Additional application notes

Experiences from testing this plugin:

* The SHM 2.0 can not be accessed directly. It must be connected to a SMA inverter. The SHM2.0 is read out through the SMA inverter. 
* It does not work with SMA STP 25000TL-30 ( Device Type: 9285 ). Right now it is unclear why STP 15.000 works and STP25.000 does not work.
