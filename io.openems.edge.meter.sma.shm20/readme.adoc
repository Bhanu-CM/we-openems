= SMA Sunny Home Manager 2.0 Integrated Meter

This implementation uses the integrated energy meter of the SMA Sunny Home Manager 2.0
Data needs to polled through Modbus from an attached SMA battery inverter as the HM2.0 does not have a local API on the device itself

Tested on::
- Sunny Home Manager 2.0 with Sunny Island 4/6/8 

Note::
The combination Sunny Home Manager and Sunny Tripower Inverter does not work. SHM seems to work with battery inverters only.   

Implemented Natures::
- SymmetricMeter
- AsymmetricMeter
