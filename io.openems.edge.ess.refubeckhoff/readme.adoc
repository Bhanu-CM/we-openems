= This implements the Refu inverter along with beckhoff computer.

This component is a Ess-component, which implements inverter and battery as one component.
Beckhoff would provide the battery values such as "Charge Max Current/Voltage, Discharge Max Current, Discharge Min Voltage, Soc... "
to the inverter and controls starting and stoping the battery. 

`ess_id`::
Id of the device. ex, ess0
`essState`::
Switches the ess into the given state, if auto is used, ess state is set automatically.
`operationState`::
Switches the  feed in power operation state.
`symmetricMode`::
In Symmetric mode no coefficients for L1/L2/L3 are available, resulting in a smaller linear equation system that is faster to solve.
`acknowledgeError`::
Number of times error to be acknowledged.
