= Compleo Eco20 

Implementation of a Compleo Eco 20 charging station. 

== Compatibility 
* Compleo Eco20 
* Wallbe Eco20

== Application Notes

* The charging station may not have an integrated meter, in which case the current, power and energy values
are calculated from the set charging current.
 
=== Dependencies
* this requires a Compleo/Wallbe EVCS with FW being at least Version 1.12.

=== Open Issues:
* this implementation is not tested with a Wallbe EVCS with integrated meter. It is tested with meter simulation mode only.
* bundle does not support the channel ManagedEvcs.SET_CHARGE_POWER_REQUEST.
