= Compleo Eco20 

Implementation of a Compleo Eco 20 charging station. 

== Compatibility 
* Compleo Eco20 
* Wallbe Eco20

== Application Notes

* charge process will be stopped when a request is below 3.45kW. Nevertheless, it will always charge with min hw power.
(e.g. config.minHwCurrent() = 10 A (6.9kW), if 4kW is requested, it charges with 6.9kW, if 3kW is requested it goes off). 
 

=== Dependencies
* this requires a Compleo/Wallbe EVCS with FW being at least Version 1.12.

=== Maturity
Production State: *-pilot projects-* 

Open Issues:
* this implementation is not tested with a Wallbe EVCS with integrated meter. It is tested with meter simulation mode only.
* bundle does not support the channel ManagedEvcs.SET_CHARGE_POWER_REQUEST.
