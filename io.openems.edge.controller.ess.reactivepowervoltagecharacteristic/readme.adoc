= Ess Rective Power Voltage Characteristic

** This controller sets reactive power to the system in order to keep the grid voltage within an acceptable range.
** The force to be applied; It is the value indicates in the multi-line graph by taking as reference the ratio of network voltage to nominal voltage.
