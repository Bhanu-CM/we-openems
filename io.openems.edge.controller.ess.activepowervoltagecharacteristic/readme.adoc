= Ess Active Power Voltage Characteristic

** This controller charge/discharge the system with active power in order to keep the grid voltage within an acceptable range.
** The force to be applied; It is the value indicates in the multi-line graph by taking as reference the ratio of network voltage to nominal voltage.
