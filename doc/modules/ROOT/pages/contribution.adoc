== Contribution Guidelines

=== General
* The OpenEMS Contribution Guidelines are based on (and complement) the link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf[Java Coding Convention].
* Limit pull requests to a small and closed topic.

=== Java code

* Limit Pull-Request to only one bundle/directory preferred. 
* Remove unnecessary console.logs.
* Remove unnecessary empty lines.
* Never use System.out.println().
* Fix all errors & warnings.
* Use precise naming for methods/functions
* Use narrow scopes for variables; avoid class variables. 
* Split code in Interface, Implementation(..Impl) and Config files. 
* Use modern Java 11 syntax (e.g. ‘var’ keyword, streams, etc.).
* Add readme.adoc to a new bundle.
* Review data in bnd.bnd file. 
* Format all files via Eclipse Autoformat, organize Imports, apply Checkstyle suggestions (see below).
* Avoid unnecessary comments on self explaining code.
* Add comments to code that is difficult to understand.
* Prefer functional programming (e.g. use Lambda expressions).
* Add JUnit tests. 
* Run ./tools/prepare-commit.sh script. 
* add a file .gitignore to empty test folder.


=== TypeScript

* Act according to the rules above wherever it makes sense to do so. 


=== Tool support

Eclipse is the official development environment. It also provides tool support for guided assistance.

.Eclipse Code formatter

Use OpenEMS Code Formatter Rules

 * Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter -> ActiveProfile -> select
 
  Java Conventions [build-in]
  
Before you checkin files, run the elipse code formatter on java sourcecode file (Ctrl + Shift + F).

.Eclipes Checkstyle plugin

Use Eclipse checkstyle plugin `Eclipse-cs`. Install it with
  
* Eclipse -> Help -> Eclipse Marketplace -> Find -> Eclipse-cs -> Install 

Configure it with

* Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> New -> 
** Type: Project Relative Configuration 
** Name: OpenEMS 
** Location: /cnf/checkstyle.xml

Later set `OpenEMS` as default.

Enable Checkstyle for every bundle you like in the Bndtools Explorer in the bundles context menu.      



=== Git-Flow workflow
* OpenEMS development follows the link:https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow[Git-Flow workflow].  
* Choose precise naming of pull request and its comments when making a pull request
* After opening the Pull-Request, review for yourself the actual changes line by line in the ‘files’ tab on Github. 
Ask for review only after you checked the actual changes again this way.  
* Ask for review when pull request is ready for review (not before!)
 
*Note:* If you realize, that you added files accidentally, you can always reset them to the current ‘develop’ state with the command ‘git checkout develop <filename>’
