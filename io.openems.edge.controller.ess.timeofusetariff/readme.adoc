= ESS Time-of-Use Tariff

This Controller optimizes the performance of an energy storage system (ESS) in conjunction with a Time-Of-Use (ToU) Tariff provider. 

It operates every 15 minutes, setting the ESS schedule for the remaining day in 15-minute intervals. 

Additionally, the controller includes two Control modes for flexible operation.

	- CHARGE_CONSUMPTION: This mode is suitable for markets where charging from the grid is allowed and preferred.
	
	- DELAY_DISCHARGE: This mode is designed for markets where charging from the grid is restricted, and the discharge is delayed accordingly.
