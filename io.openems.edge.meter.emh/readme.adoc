= io.openems.edge.meter.emh

Implementation of an EMH LZQJ meter with modbus interface. The modbus addresses are configured by the metering point service provider (german: Messstellenbetreiber) and are set according to OBIS values.
These addresses are unfortunately individual and have to by configured within the moduleÂ´s source code.
