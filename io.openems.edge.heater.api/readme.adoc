= Heater API 

General Natures for heating devices. Heating devices are separated into 

* `Chp` - Combined Heat and Power devices which can be monitored
* `ManagedChp` - manageable Combined Heat and Power devices
* `Heatpump` - Heatpumps which can be monitored
* `ManagedHeatpump` - manageable heatpumps (most probably SG ready heatpumps) 
* `Heater` - heater devices base nature 
* `ManagedHeaterByOperationMode` - heater devices which can be managed by operation mode

*Note:* 

* in principle, manageable heaters can be controlled in four different ways:
** controlled by operation mode  (currently provided)
** controlled by thermal heat power setpoint (may be added in the future)
** controlled by flow temperature setpoint (may be added in the future)
** controlled by electric production power (see ManagedChp)

* as there are currently no hydrogen natures, the `Chp` nature can be used. Both 
provide heat end electrical power.
